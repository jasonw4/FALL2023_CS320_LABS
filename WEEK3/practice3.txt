1) Please implement a function that converts a given
mylist 'xs' into another mylist 'ys' by removing the
constructor 'MyReverse':
//
let rec mylist_remove_reverse(xs: 'a mylist): 'a mylist
//
In particular, your implementation should guarantee:
1. 'xs' and 'ys' represent the same list
2. 'ys' does NOT make any use of 'MyReverse'
3. 'xs' and 'ys' use the same number of 'MyAppend2'
