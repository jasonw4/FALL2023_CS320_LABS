#### The Reality ####
In reality, <1% of you guys are ever going to touch a functional programming language (Haskell, OCaml, Scala, etc).
There are jobs that require the knowledge of knowing a functional programming language as it is a good way to build maintainable, error free code. It is actually used in some scenarios, particularly for building backend systems. Can be found in fintech, finance, telecommunications,
robotics, aerospace, etc...
However, if you aren't going to be working in those niche jobs, and you are wondering if you will actually need anything that you learn in this class, here are the key takeaways for the semester:

#### Recursion ####
Recursion is a powerful tool, and exists in object oriented languages, imperative languages, functional languages, etc...
Most commonly, recursive algorithms can be seen in DSA concepts (Graph Traversals, Tree Traversals, Binary Search, Quicksort, Mergesort, etc). It also exists in fields such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and databases.

#### High Order Functions ####
High order functions do not solely exist on OCaml. Since programming up until this class has mostly been loop-based, this might come as a shock. High order functions really do simplify code and make it easier to maintain. When your codebase is large, high order functions can help condense it. High order functions are used in fullstack dev (React has functional properties, with map and filter being the most used to parse the large amount of JSON data that a frontend can receive. Node uses high order functions to manage callbacks and promises.), Data Science and Machine Learning ((Python), high order functions are essential in processing large datasets (You might have heard of MapReduce)), and a variety of other fields in industry. So these type of functions are not unique to functional programming languages :)

#### Lambda Functions ####
Pretty similar explanation to High Order functions as they are often used together, lambda functions reduce the length of your code and make it look more eloquent. It exists in many languages, including Javascript, Python as mentioned above + more. 

#### Data Structures ####
Obviously data structures still exist, such as lists and tuples, albeit a bit different from what you are used to. Still good to keep in mind.

#### Other structures in OCaml ####
Probably won't be covered in this class, but OCaml has a lot of other features, such as variants and records, but similar concepts are found in other languages. You might have heard of enums, structs, interfaces, classes, etc...

#### Time Complexity ####
Not sure how important this will be emphasized this particular semester, but knowing algorithm runtimes will always be important and will help you out when it comes to technical interviews.

#### Theory ####
The theory part of this class will be interesting if ... well, if you are interested in theory of compilers and interpreters. Pretty much sets you up for the graduate classes that dive into deeper detail about these sort of topics :)

I might be missing something but this should be a good list of how you can apply the topics of this class into future use (Maybe :))
